# Guardian
💪 Motivation/Inspiration
Women safety is growing global concern with women being victims of abuse and assault in all spheres of their day to day lives. 
With our app Guardian we envision to provide women a sense of security so that they can venture into any horizon in life and yet be connected to their safety network.
Our web app gives women the feedom and sense of safety they deserve. Easy to use and learn , this app is a handy tool for not just women but for public in general if travelling alone or to unknown places.
We have been able to develop safety routes based on previous data records on crime statistics. We have added the feature of SOS alert to emergency contacts and police along with the victims current location.
